# The English Women's Football (EWF) Database

The English Women's Football (EWF) Database is an open database of matches played in the top tiers of professional women's football in England. It covers all matches played since the 2011 season for the highest division (the Women's Super League) and since the 2014 season for the second-highest division (the Women's Championship).

## A brief recent history of professional women's football in England

With the first season held in 2011, the Women's Super League replaced the FA Women's Premier League National Division as the highest division of women's football in England. A second division was introduced for this new structure in 2014 which meant teams could be promoted and relegated.

Since the competition's start, all games in a season were played in a single year (a summer league). This changed from the 2017-2018 season, when games were played across two years (a winter league) to align with the traditional English football calendar. For this change to take place, a shortened series of games was played in 2017 (known as the Spring Series). This is included in the database for completeness, under the 2017-2017 season.

As the 2019-2020 season was cut short in early May due to the Covid pandemic, the final standings in each league were based on a points-per-game average.

Due to repeated changes in the structure of women's football in England, promoted and relegated teams have not always been those that finished top and bottom of their division, respectively. For example, Doncaster Rovers Belles (`T-011-T`) placed first in the 2017-2018 tier 2 division but were ultimately relegated to tier 3 because they withdrew from the league for financial reasons. There has been a more consistent approach since the 2020-2021 season, with 12 teams in each division.

## Using the data

The database contains three datasets:

* `matches` contains all matches that have been played and has one observation per match per season.
* `appearances` contains all appearances by a team and has one observation per team per match per season.
* `standings` contains all end-of-the-season division tables and has one observation per team per season.

Each dataset is provided as a CSV file in the `data` folder. These can be accessed by either cloning this GitHub repository or by downloading a copy by clicking 'Code' and then 'Download Zip' near the top of this page.

All three datasets will be updated with the latest information at the end of each season.

## Description of the data

The data in the English Women's Football (EWF) Database has been collected from multiple online sources. All information is cross-referenced against at least one other separate source to confirm its accuracy. Information in the database is also cross-referenced with itself to ensure consistency. For example, that a team's `goals_for` at the end of the season in `standings` is equal to the number of goals they have scored across all games played in `matches`.

Each team has been given a unique ID in the format of `T-###-T`. This is to enable the tracking of team performance across multiple seasons, as most teams have changed their name over time. For example, Arsenal Ladies became Arsenal Women before the start of the 2017-2018 season, but the same ID is used for them throughout the database (`T-001-T`). The name of the team included in each dataset is the name of the team at the time. Any generic name terms such as 'Football Club' or 'F.C.' have been removed. Reference to 'Women' or 'Ladies' is included in the team name, where applicable, to indicate changes that have occurred. However, most teams do not explicitly reference 'Women' or 'Ladies' in their name unless it is to distinguish between the male and female teams.
